# Empty file that exists only for purposes of making the python-heatclient
# library happy. `heatclient.commmon.template_utils.get_template_contents`
# resolves any embedded files, e.g., `get_file`.  It complains if it cannot
# find a file at the given path. This file exists simply to prevent that error.
#
# When the cluster types are generated from the templates, this file will be
# replaced for that cluster type with an appropriatly generated file instead.
