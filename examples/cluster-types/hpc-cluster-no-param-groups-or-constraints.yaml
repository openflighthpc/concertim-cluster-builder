  This launches the same cluster as "High-Performance Computing".  This cluster
  type exists to demonstrate the need for paramater groups, parameter
  constraints and hard-coding of some parameters.

  This cluster type does not have any paramter groups, paramter constraints or
  hard-coded values specified.

  The lack of parameter groups, means that the parameter order is consistent
  but arbitrary.

  The lack of paramter constraints means that visualiser is not able to create
  drop downs for things such as flavours and images, and that visualiser cannot
  perform validation on CIDRs and IP addresses.

  The lack of hard-coded values, means that the user is exposed to networks,
  CIDRs and IP addresses that are perhaps best hidden from them.

  The cluster type "HPC -- parameter groups and constraints" demonstrates how
  to add paramter groups and constraints.  You can see how that is done by
  diffing the HOTs for the two cluster type.

# The kind or type of this cluster template.
kind: heat

# Any of the parameters defined in `heat_template_url` can be hardcoded here.
# If they are hardcoded, the value provided here will be passed to Heat when
# launching the cluster.  It will not be possible for the user to override this
# value.
# hardcoded_parameters:
#   external-network: public1
#   network-cidr-pri: 10.100.0.0/16
#   gateway-pri-ip: 10.100.0.101
#   infra01-pri-ip: 10.100.0.102
#   infra02-pri-ip: 10.100.0.103
#   storage1-pri-ip: 10.100.0.104

# The path to the HOT template to use for this cluster-type.
#
# Paths are relative to the `hot` directory in the Flask servers instance path
# directory.
#
# Currently, each cluster type supports running a single HOT template.
