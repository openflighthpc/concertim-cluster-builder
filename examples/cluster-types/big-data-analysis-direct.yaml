  Launch an Apache Hadoop cluster to process large data sets across a
  distributed computing environment.  The Sahara cluster is launched directly
  (not via a Heat template).  A network is not created.

# The parameters to expose through Concertim.  There could be a parameter for
# each of the command line arguments accepted by `openstack dataprocessing cluster create`
# or a subset. It is a template author error to have parameters here that do
# not map to a command line argument of `openstack dataprocessing cluster create`.
parameters:
  user_keypair:
    type: string
    label: "SSH keypair to use"
    description: "The name or ID of the keypair to use."

  # Unfortunately, this does need to be the ID and not the name at the moment.
  network_id:
    type: string
    label: Network
    description:  The ID of the network to launch the cluster on.

  image:
    type: string
    label: "Sahara image"

# The kind or type of this cluster template.
kind: sahara

# The name of the sahara cluster template used when creating sahara clusters
# from this cluster type definition.
#
# * The sahara cluster template must have already been created in sahara.
# * The sahara cluster template must be public. Or at least be available to all
#   concertim users.
#
# It is a template author error if either of the above conditions is not met.
