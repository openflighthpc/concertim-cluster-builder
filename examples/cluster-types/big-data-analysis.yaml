# Any of the parameters defined in `heat_template_url` can be hardcoded here.
# If they are hardcoded, the value provided here will be passed to Heat when
# launching the cluster.  It will not be possible for the user to override this
# value.

# The path to the HOT template to use for this cluster-type.
