  Launch an Apache Hadoop cluster to process large data sets across a
  distributed computing environment.  The Sahara cluster is launched via a Heat
  template, allowing for a network to be created specifically for the cluster.

# The kind or type of this cluster template.
kind: heat

# Any of the parameters defined in `heat_template_url` can be hardcoded here.
# If they are hardcoded, the value provided here will be passed to Heat when
# launching the cluster.  It will not be possible for the user to override this
# value.
#
# For sahara cluster types it might be desirable to hard code the
# cluster-template, image, plugin and hadoop version, rather than present those
# questions to the user.  The cluster-template and image values need to be the
# ID and not the name.
hardcoded_parameters:
  external-network: public1
  network-cidr-pri: 10.100.0.0/16
  # hadoop-version: "2.7.1"
  # cluster-template: "741102fd-6b59-4a4a-af71-0bbf039f0338"
  # image: "ab7e7129-9962-413a-9bf1-3e1965424f43"
  # plugin-name: "vanilla"


# The path to the HOT template to use for this cluster-type.
#
# Paths are relative to the `hot` directory in the Flask servers instance path
# directory.
#
# Currently, each cluster type supports running a single HOT template.
#
# There is a generic HOT available for sahara clusters to use.  It creates a
# new network for the cluster and contains parameters to configure the networks
# creation.
heat_template_url: sahara/create-network.yaml
