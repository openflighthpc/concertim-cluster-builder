  Launch a cluster for standard HPC workflows.  The cluster will run a Slurm
  scheduler for managing HPC jobs workloads.  The latest version of Flight User
  suite and Flight Web suite will be installed.

  Once the cluster is ready you will be able to access it via SSH using the SSH
  key you have configured, or through the Flight Web suite.

# launching the cluster.  It will not be possible for the user to override this
# value.

# The path to the HOT template to use for this cluster-type.
#
# Paths are relative to the `hot` directory in the Flask servers instance path
# directory.
