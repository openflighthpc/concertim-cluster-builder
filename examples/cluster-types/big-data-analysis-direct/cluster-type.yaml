  Launch an Apache Hadoop cluster to process large data sets across a
  distributed computing environment.  The Sahara cluster is launched directly
  (not via a Heat template).  A network is not created.

    parameters:
      - user_keypair

# The parameters to expose through Concertim.  There could be a parameter for
# each of the command line arguments accepted by `openstack dataprocessing cluster create`
# or a subset. It is a template author error to have parameters here that do
# not map to a command line argument of `openstack dataprocessing cluster create`.

    description:  The ID of the network to launch the cluster on.
    # This constraint doesn't work at the moment.  There is a conflict between
    # whether the value for the network is its name or its UUID.  Sahara
    # requires it to be the UUID, but HEAT templates require it to be the name
    # (or at least they require that if we are to have easy-to-implement
    # defaults).  This can be fixed by having the sahara handler retrieve the
    # network id from the network name.  See the comment in the sahara handler
    # for the issue with doing that.

    #    - custom_constraint: neutron.network

  image:

# * The sahara cluster template must have already been created in sahara.
# * The sahara cluster template must be public. Or at least be available to all
#   concertim users.
