      It will take about 10 minutes for the cluster to launch and fully
      configure itself to be ready for usage. Progress of the application can
      be verified as complete when `flight profile list` on `gateway1` shows a
      status of `complete`.

      Once launched, you can access the cluster via ssh to the public IP of
      `gateway1` as the user `flight` with the private key that corresponds to
      the key-pair you selected.

      ### Accessing System

      Once the cluster is fully configured, the [Flight Web
      Suite](https://www.openflighthpc.org/latest/docs/flight-environment/use-flight/flight-web-suite/)
      will be accessible at the public IP of `gateway1`.  You can find a link
      on the rack's "Overview" tab.

      The password for Flight Web Suite is the password you entered when launching the cluster.

      You can also access the cluster via ssh to the public IP of `gateway1` as the
      user `flight` with the private key that corresponds with the key-pair you
      selected.  You can find the public IP of `gateway1` on the rack's "Overview"
      tab.

      ### Copying Data Across

      See the [HPC Environment Basics guide to Working with Data and
      Files](https://www.openflighthpc.org/latest/docs/hpc-environment-basics/linux-usage/working-with-data/).
      You can find the IP address of the `gateway1` node on the rack's "Overview"
      tab.

      Additionally, data can be copied to the cluster using the [Flight File
      Manager](https://www.openflighthpc.org/latest/docs/flight-environment/use-flight/flight-web-suite/file-manager/)
      in Flight Web Suite.
