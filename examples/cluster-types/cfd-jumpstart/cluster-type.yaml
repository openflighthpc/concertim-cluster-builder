  A multinode, single-user SLURM environment with OpenFOAM 22.12, Paraview &
  OpenMPI ready to go

      It will take about 15 minutes for the cluster to launch and fully
      configure itself to be ready for usage. Progress of the application can
      be verified as complete when `flight profile list` on `gateway1` shows a
      status of `complete`.

      Once launched, you can access the cluster via ssh to the public IP of
      `gateway1` as the user `flight` with the private key that corresponds
      with the key-pair you selected.

      ### Accessing System

      Once the cluster is fully configured, the [Flight Web
      Suite](https://www.openflighthpc.org/latest/docs/flight-environment/use-flight/flight-web-suite/)
      will be accessible at the public IP of `gateway1`.  You can find a link
      on the rack's "Overview" tab.

      The password for Flight Web Suite is auto-generated at launch and is
      available at `/root/flight_user_pass.txt` on `gateway1`.

      You can also access the cluster via ssh to the public IP of `gateway1` as the
      user `flight` with the private key that corresponds to the key-pair you
      selected.  You can find the public IP of `gateway1` on the rack's "Overview"
      tab.


      ### Copying Data Across

      The IP address of the `gateway1` node should be shared with you by the
      system administrator for this cluster.  Once received, see the [HPC
      Environment Basics guide to Working with Data and
      Files](https://www.openflighthpc.org/latest/docs/hpc-environment-basics/linux-usage/working-with-data/).

      The cluster has shared storage configured for the following directories:

      - `/home`: For user home directories. Note that this directory does not utilise the shared storage disk of `gateway1`
      and therefore should not be used for project data
      - `/opt/apps`: For installing shared applications
      - `/opt/data`: For user project data
      - `/opt/service`: For admin data and shared system configuration scripts
      - `/opt/site`: For any other shared data or information on the cluster or site

      Note that, while the `/home` directory is shared across the cluster, it
      does not utilise the shared storage disk of `gateway1` and therefore
      should not be used for project data

      Additionally, data can be copied to the cluster using the [Flight File
      Manager](https://www.openflighthpc.org/latest/docs/flight-environment/use-flight/flight-web-suite/file-manager/)
      in Flight Web Suite.

      ### Accessing CFD Tools

      OpenFOAM 22.12 is installed under `/opt/apps/` and is therefore shared
      across all the nodes in the cluster.

      Paraview and OpenMPI have been installed via system packages. The
      `gateway1` node is the only one with Paraview installed and OpenMPI is
      installed on every compute node.
