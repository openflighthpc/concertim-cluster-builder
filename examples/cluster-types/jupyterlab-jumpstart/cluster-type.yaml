      It will take about 10 minutes for the cluster to launch and fully
      configure itself to be ready for usage. Progress of the application can
      be verified as complete when `flight profile list` on `gateway1` shows a
      status of `complete`.

      Once launched, you can access the cluster via ssh to the public IP of
      `gateway1` as the user `flight` with the private key that corresponds
      with the key-pair you selected above.

      ### Accessing System

      Once the cluster is fully configured, the [Flight Web
      Suite](https://www.openflighthpc.org/latest/docs/flight-environment/use-flight/flight-web-suite/)
      will be accessible at the public IP of `gateway1`.  You can find a link
      on the rack's "Overview" tab.

      The password for both Flight Web Suite and JupyterLab is the password you
      entered when launching the cluster.

      You can also access the cluster via ssh to the public IP of `gateway1` as the
      user `flight` with the private key that corresponds with the key-pair you
      selected.  You can find the public IP of `gateway1` on the rack's "Overview"
      tab.

      ### Copying Data Across

      The IP address of the `gateway1` node should be shared with you by the
      system administrator for this cluster.  Once received, see the [HPC
      Environment Basics guide to Working with Data and
      Files](https://www.openflighthpc.org/latest/docs/hpc-environment-basics/linux-usage/working-with-data/).

      Additionally, data can be copied to the cluster using the [Flight File
      Manager](https://www.openflighthpc.org/latest/docs/flight-environment/use-flight/flight-web-suite/file-manager/)
      in Flight Web Suite.
