  This launches the same cluster as "High-Performance Computing".  This cluster
  type exists to demonstrate the use of paramater groups and parameter
  constraints, and the need for hard-coding of some parameters.

  This cluster type has sensible parameter groups and parameter constraints
  providing a better UI/UX over "HPC -- Ugly".  However, it does not contain
  any hard-coded values.

  The lack of hard-coding exposes the user to CIDRs, IPs and openstack
  networks.  Whilst these have defaults, exposing them to the user allows the
  user to change them and hence break them.

  The cluster type "High-Performance Computing" demonstrates how to add
  hard-coding for some parameters. You can see how that is done by diffing the
  cluster type defintions for the two cluster types.

# The kind or type of this cluster template.
kind: heat

# Any of the parameters defined in `heat_template_url` can be hardcoded here.
# If they are hardcoded, the value provided here will be passed to Heat when
# launching the cluster.  It will not be possible for the user to override this
# value.
# hardcoded_parameters:
#   external-network: public1
#   network-cidr-pri: 10.100.0.0/16
#   gateway-pri-ip: 10.100.0.101
#   infra01-pri-ip: 10.100.0.102
#   infra02-pri-ip: 10.100.0.103
#   storage1-pri-ip: 10.100.0.104

# The path to the HOT template to use for this cluster-type.
#
# Paths are relative to the `hot` directory in the Flask servers instance path
# directory.
#
# Currently, each cluster type supports running a single HOT template.
