# Brief description of the purpose of the cluster.
title: High-Performance Computing (HPC)

# Fuller description of the purpose of the cluster and how to use it.
description: |
  Launch a cluster for standard HPC workflows.  The cluster will run a Slurm
  scheduler for managing HPC jobs workloads.  The latest version of Flight User
  suite and Flight Web suite will be installed.

  Once the cluster is ready you will be able to access it via SSH using the SSH
  key you have configured, or through the Flight Web suite.

# The parameters to expose through Concertim.  This could be the full set of
# parameters for the HEAT template or a subset.  It is a template author error
# to have parameters here that are not present in the heat template.
#
# Perhaps this could read the parameters directly from the HEAT template instead.
# Perhaps this could provide a mechanism to expose those parameters.
# If so, we should probably support adding label, description and constraints.
parameters:
  clustername:
    type: string
    label: Cluster name
    description: The name your cluster should be given
    default: mycluster
    constraints:
      - length: { min: 6, max: 255 }
        description: Cluster name must be between 6 and 255 characters
      - allowed_pattern: "[a-zA-Z]+[a-zA-Z0-9\\-\\_]*"
        description: Cluster name can contain only alphanumeric characters, hyphens and underscores

  count:
    type: number
    label: Number of compute nodes
    description: How many compute nodes should your cluster contain?
    default: 3
    constraints:
      - range: { min: 1 }
        description: Number of compute nodes cannot be less than one

  node-flavour:
    type: string
    label: Node flavour
    description: Which flavour should be be used for the compute nodes?
    default: m1.small
    constraints:
      - allowed_values:
        - m1.small
        - m1.medium

# Below here we have a list of attributes that are specific to a given cluster
# type.  That is HOT/HEAT will have different attributes than, say, sahara.
#
# Perhaps these need to have already been checked out.  Or perhaps they can be
# specified as a URL in the API call to HOT.
#
# Some templates such as those used in cluster-building-blocks are created from
# multiple HEAT templates.  Need to consider how that is going to be handled.
heat_template_url: path or URL to heat template to use for this cluster type
